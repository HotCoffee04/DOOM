# Coffee Doom

Welcome to yet another port of Doom.


## The goal of this port

This port was more of a coding experiment to learn SDL2 rather than an actual attempt of creating a source port able to compete with the other ones.
As such this port is still incomplete and unfinished but currently able run Doom even though it suffers from sound distortion.
## Missing features
* Networking
* Proper music and sound implementation
* Setup program

## Compiling and running

Currently this port only aims to work on Windows.
To compile it first you need the SDL2 development libraries. 
``SetupSDL.bat`` is a script that will automatically download and extract them for you.
Once the libraries are installed open the Visual Studio 2019 solution and compile and run.
