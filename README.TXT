This is a fork of the original "linuxdoom" released in 1997.
Right now it doesn't add any particular features besides some fixes I applied to make 
the game compile on modern linux.

To compile simply run "make" inside linuxdoom-1.10.
After it generated the executable run "createDisplay.sh" which will open a 
virtual display capable of running Doom (you need "Xephyr" installed on your system)
Then execute "runDoom.sh"
